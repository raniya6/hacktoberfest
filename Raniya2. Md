u seriously doesn't know how to explain it to others, whenever u c him u feel
awkward and cannot even smile at him but u can smile 2 the rest of the world 
u seriously feel at tyms the other person has that awkwardness so badly 
u feel at Tim's the other person has tht awkwardness 2.u slowly started getting butterflies in ur stomach (not the symptoms of hunger thou *_*)
